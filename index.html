                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This content was written by Rose Johnson.</p>
                    <p>Prior to taking this Writing and Digital Media class, I had a little, very basic, knowledge of HTML and CSS and no practical digital writing experience. Through participating in this class, I hope to continue expanding my abilities, in regard to both my writing and my use of digital media, so I can gain a more well-rounded skill set.</p>
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>I am a sophomore at Virginia Tech, majoring in Professional and Technical Writing and planning to graduate in spring of 2019. I hope to use the skills I learn during my years here as a technical writer after graduation, so the material I am learning in this class and similar ones is highly relevant to my future.</p>
                    <p>While I tend to prefer the classes focused on “traditional” liberal arts subjects, I recognize that aspiring to Virginia Tech’s ideal of the VT-shaped person will broaden both my skill set and my world view. The classes I have taken since arriving at Virginia Tech fall primarily into the “vertical” and “horizontal” categories; through taking them, I have improved not only my writing, but my ability to research and analyze. The “enhanced T” does not fit as readily into my major and my personal goals, but the “V” section does, and while I have not yet managed to incorporate it into my studies in any significant way, I hope to do so in the future.</p>
